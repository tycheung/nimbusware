# Safe Coding (Maker persona)

Safe Coding is for builders who want working software with **fewer errors**, not deep engineering tooling. It uses the **`safe_coding`** workflow profile, **guided autopilot**, and **maker approval** before changes apply.

## When to use

- You are new to software development or prefer plain-language progress
- You want tests, browser checks, and security critics before each slice lands
- You prefer pauses when checks fail rather than auto-advancing

## Setup

1. Install with the **default** setup bundle (`--setup-bundle default`).
2. On first Maker launch, choose **Safe Coding** in the archetype picker.
3. On **Home**, use the **Prepare workspace** wizard (readiness → scaffold → pre-commit → Playwright bootstrap) — no terminal steps required.
4. Keep enforcement at **Balanced** (level 5) or higher.

## What you get

| Control | Safe Coding default |
|---------|---------------------|
| Workflow | `safe_coding` for slices; **`safe_coding_campaign_fullstack`** for greenfield “build an app” campaigns |
| Autopilot | `guided` — pauses on gate and regression failures |
| Enforcement | `balanced` |
| Auto-advance | Off |
| Collab | Off (use Engineer workspace preset for teams) |

## Home wizard (zero-terminal)

When Safe Coding is active, Maker **Home** shows:

- A **readiness ribbon** with plain-language workspace status
- A first-run **Prepare workspace** panel that chains:
  - `GET /v1/platform/workspace-readiness`
  - `POST /v1/platform/workspace-scaffold`
  - `POST /v1/platform/workspace-precommit`
  - `POST /v1/platform/playwright-bootstrap` then poll `GET` every few seconds until `status` is `ready`
- After preparation, **Build full-stack app** opens Chat in campaign mode with scope discovery and manifest approval

Starting a `safe_coding` run auto-scaffolds missing smoke tests when the workspace lacks `tests/e2e` and `tests/test_smoke.py`. Full-stack campaigns use the merged workflow with contract gate, maker approval, and optional **frontend-owasp** critic pack.

## Industry critic packs (Settings)

When Safe Coding is active, **Settings** shows an optional **Industry critic pack** selector (`fintech-api`, `healthcare-api`). Preferences persist per user via `GET/PUT /v1/platform/safe-coding-preferences`.

## Plain-language gates

Progress and Review show gate steps as short sentences (e.g. “Automated tests: failed — review before continuing”) instead of raw stage ids.

## Workspace helpers

- **Readiness** — `GET /v1/platform/workspace-readiness?workspace_path=` checks for Playwright, tests, and project markers.
- **Scaffold** — `POST /v1/platform/workspace-scaffold` adds minimal `tests/e2e` or `tests/test_smoke.py` when missing (also invoked automatically on first `safe_coding` run).
- **Pre-commit** — `POST /v1/platform/workspace-precommit` installs a consumer `.pre-commit-config.yaml` template (ruff + pytest smoke).
- **Playwright bootstrap** — `GET/POST /v1/platform/playwright-bootstrap` installs browser binaries for Individual edition without shell commands in Maker copy.
